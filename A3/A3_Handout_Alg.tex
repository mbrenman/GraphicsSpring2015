\section{Instructions}
Complete this assignment only with your teammate. You may use a
calculator or computer algebra system. All your answers should be given in simplest form.
When a numerical answer is required, provide a reduced fraction (i.e. 1/3) or at least three
decimal places (i.e. 0.333). Show all work; write your answers on this sheet. This algorithm handout is worth 3\% of your final grade for the class.

\section{OpenGL Commands}
\begin{framed}
\noindent {\bf [${{1}\over{2}}$ point each]} Suppose you want to apply a transformation matrix to some vertices. In what order should you use the following five OpenGL commands?
\begin{verbatim}
     __5__ glEnd()
     __1__ glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW)
     __3__ glBegin()
     __2__ glLoadMatrix()
     __4__ glVertex4fv()
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}


\begin{framed}
\noindent {\bf [$1 {{1}\over{2}}$ points]} Suppose your program contained a block of code which sent vertices to OpenGL, delimited by {\tt glBegin()} and {\tt glEnd()}. What would be the effect of a call to {\tt glLoadMatrix()} within this block?


OpenGL will throw the {\tt GL\_INVALID\_OPERATION} execption.

\end{framed}

\section{Scenefiles}
Consider the following excerpt from a scenefile.
\begin{verbatim}
<transblock>
     <translate x="0" y=".5" z="0"/>
     <scale x=".05" y="1.0" z=".05"/>
     <rotate x="1" y="0" z="0" angle="45"/>
     <object type="primitive" name="cylinder">
          <diffuse r="1" g="1" b="1"/> 
     </object>
</transblock>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{framed}
\noindent {\bf [$1 {{1}\over{2}}$ points]}  To transform a point on the cylinder $C$ into the desired cylinder $C'$, in which order would you multiply the three transformations: translate ($T$), rotate ($R$), and scale ($S$) to achieve the desired effect?
\begin{verbatim}


 C' = _______T * S * R_______ * C
 
\end{verbatim} 
\end{framed}

\noindent In a previous question you described how to compose transformations within a single transformation block (trans block). When coding {\tt Sceneview}, you will also have to compose transformations whenever there is an object tree block contained within a trans block. Consider the following contrived excerpt from a scenefile:
\begin{verbatim}
<transblock>
  <rotate x="0" y="1" z="0" angle="60"/> 
  <scale x=".5" y=".5" z=".5"/>
  <object type="tree">
    <transblock>
      <translate x="0" y="2" z="0"/>
      <scale x="1" y=".5" z="1"/>
      <object type="primitive" name="sphere">
        <diffuse r="1" g="1" b="0"/> 
      </object>
    </transblock> 
  </object>
</transblock>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{framed}
\noindent {\bf [$1 {{1}\over{2}}$ points]}  Suppose you composed the two transformations in the outer trans block, calling the result CTM1, and composed the transformations in the inner trans block, calling the result CTM2. Show the order in which you must multiply these matrices to obtain a single composite matrix with the desired effect on the sphere.
\end{framed}

\begin{framed}

We would want to apply CTM2 first, so the combined CTM matrix would be:

CTM = CTM1 * CTM2

\end{framed}


\section{Parse Tree}
Being sure of the order in which matrices must be multiplied puts you well on your way to completing {\tt Sceneview}. The other major hurdle is deciding how you will traverse the parse tree provided by {\tt SceneParser}.
\begin{framed}
\noindent {\bf [1 point]} In your most efficient program design, when and how many times should you traverse the original parse tree?
We would only need to traverse the tree once. We do this in the beginning to flatten it, and then we use the flattened version from then on.
\end{framed}
\begin{framed}
\noindent {\bf [1 point]} Flattening the parse tree makes it quicker and easier to traverse when drawing the scene. What type of data structure will you use for this flattened tree?

We could use a STL vector to hold the flattened tree.

\end{framed}
\begin{framed}
\noindent {\bf [1 point]} What information will you store at each of the nodes in the flattened tree? Please give valid types and descriptions of any types you are defining yourself.

Each node in the flattened tree will hold the object primitive and the composite matrix needed to correctly position/rotate/scale that object. Then, each node in the flattened tree will not need to be aware of its parents, since it will hold the full matrix. This matrix will be created during the initial tree traversal.

The matrix will be the Matrix type from Algebra.h, and then object will be a subclass of Shape (as created in assignment 1). This will all be held in a struct.

\end{framed}
