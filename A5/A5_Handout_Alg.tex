\section{Instructions}
Complete this assignment only with your teammate. When a numerical answer is required, provide a reduced fraction (i.e. 1/3) or at least three decimal places (i.e. 0.333). Show all work; write your answers on this sheet. This algorithm handout is worth 3\% of your final grade for the class.

\begin{framed}
\noindent{\bf[2 points]} The high-level view of our ray tracer is exactly the same as for intersect, except for a few additions. Below is the high-level pseudocode for {\tt Intersect}. What needs to be changed/added to make this a full-fledged raytracer? Just specify what changes need to be made {no pseudocode please.}

\footnotesize{
\begin{algorithmic}
\FOR{$point \in Canvas$}
	\STATE Cast a ray to find the nearest object
	\IF{ray intersects an object}
		\FOR{each light}
			\STATE Cast a ray to the light and evaluate the lighting equation\\
			\STATE $Canvas[pt] = Canvas[pt]+ color$ with only diffuse/ambient components\\
		\ENDFOR
	\ELSE 
		\STATE $Canvas[pt] =$ background color
	\ENDIF
\ENDFOR

\vspace{3em}

After the nearest object is found, we need to calculate the ray that bounces off of that object (which depends on the surface normal and the ray that we sent) and incorporate the colors from that (which can recursively be called). The amount that this added portion affects the color depends on properties of the surface.

\end{algorithmic}

\begin{framed}
\noindent{\bf[2 points]} Given a vector $\vec{v}$ and a surface normal $\vec{n}$, find the equation for the vector $\vec{r}$ which is the reflection of $\vec{v}$ about $\vec{n}$ (i.e. in the equal and opposite direction). Write your equation in terms of vector operations. How do you compute the color contributed by the reflected ray? Give a brief description.
% \includegraphics[width=2.8in]{reflection.png}

The equation for the reflected ray is:\\
$\hat{r} = \vec{d} - 2(\hat{d}\cdot\hat{n})\hat{n}$\\


The color added is the color based on what that reflected ray hits (which may depend on recursive reflections) and the reflective properties about the surface.

\begin{framed}
\noindent{\bf[1 point]} Is ray tracing a local or global illumination algorithm? Why? \\

Recursive ray tracing is a global illumination algorithm because it factors in indirect lighting due to the light bouncing off of other objects. Non-recursive ray tracing, however, is local because it only deals with direct illumination.

\end{framed}

\begin{framed}
\noindent{\bf[1 point]} For a particular ray that intersects with an object, when do you not consider contribution from a given light source? How do you computationally determine when this scenario occurs?

\end{framed}

\begin{framed}
\noindent{\bf[2 points]} Recall that we can think of texture mapping in two steps. First, mapping from the object to the unit square, and second, mapping from the unit square to the texture map. Let $a$ and $b$ be the $x$ and $y$ values in the unit square that a particular point on an object gets mapped to in the first step. Note that $a$ and $b$ are calculated differently depending on the object. From here, how do you find the coordinates $(s, t)$ to look up in a texture map in terms of $a, b, u, v, w$ and $h$, where $u$ and $v$ are the number of repetitions in the $x$ and $y$
directions, respectively, $w$ is the texture width, and $h$ is the texture height?
